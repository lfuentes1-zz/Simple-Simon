##What inspired the design of the game?
###When I was about 15-years-old, I fell in love with Mickey Mouse.  For years, I would collect
###everything I could about Mickey Mouse.  I managed to make it to Disney World and Disneyland 4 times (or three, I can't 
###remember :expressionless:) and come back with suit cases filled with Mickey Mouse collectives.  I fell out of love about ten years after ###starting my collection.  Although I still have many of those items I collected, I also donated and gave away many of them.  The ###inspiration for this design of the Simon Game came from the love for Mickey Mouse during those ten years.  Disneyland and Disney
###World have everything that one can find regarding Mickey Mouse; but, one thing I never managed to find was a Mickey-Mouse-###shaped Simon Game.  Therefore, I designed my own!  Enjoy the game!
